        You can use LumX in your Sass project to get all variables and mixins available.<br />

    <lx-component lx-title="Common settings" lx-path="/includes/getting-started/customization/variable.html" lx-language="css" lx-is-open="true" lx-no-demo="true">
        You can override LumX default settings <code>dist/scss/settings/_defaults.scss</code> if you want to change sizes, main colors, etc.<br />
        For example, in a settings file located in your project <code>scss/settings/_common.scss</code>.

    <lx-component lx-title="Main SCSS file" lx-path="/includes/getting-started/customization/main.html" lx-language="css" lx-is-open="true" lx-no-demo="true">
        Then, create your main file where you will import your settings first and then LumX main scss file <code>dist/scss/_lumx.scss</code>.<br />
        For example, in your main file located in your project <code>scss/my-project.scss</code>.

            Weâ€™d like to thank Harry Roberts for his CSS framework, <a href="https://github.com/inuitcss" target="_blank">Inuitcss</a>, which is a powerful, scalable, Sass-based, BEM, OOCSS framework.<br />
            LumX CSS framework is largely inspired from his work.
